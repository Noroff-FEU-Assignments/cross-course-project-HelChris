        <p id="web-security-question"><h3>How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks?</h3></p>

        <p id="web-security-answer">Some advise to a potential client to secure their website from web security attacks. To hinder XSS, XSRF, SQL Injections and other mischief with: 
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Research.</strong> Go for the well-known and well-used third-party applications/libraries. </li><br>
        
        <li><strong>HTTPS:</strong> Use secure HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) by combining HTTP with TLS (Transport Layer Security) = HTTPS = secure and encrypted communication between the server and the client. So that sensitive information (login info, personal data etc.) stays protected. </li><br>
        
        <li><strong>Strong! passwords:</strong> Always use strong passwords, consider using a (well-known and well-used) password manager to help you create and safekeeping strong passwords.  </li><br>
        
        <li><strong>Sanitize and validate data:</strong> after doing research implement the use of a solution like the  sanitize-html package in NodeJS or an ORM(Object Related Mapping) library for SQL related code. </li><br>
        
        <li><strong>Go for all the updates!</strong> Keep the software and all the things up to date to ensure security flaws are being plugged and patched to stay ahead of hackers.  </li><br>

        <li><strong>Secure authorization and authentication:</strong> with the use of an open-standard authorization protocol or framework like onelogin. </li><br>

        <li><strong>Implement Automatic user timeout:</strong> don't let the sensitive information swirl around in the browser for a long time.</li><br>

        <li><strong>A Content Security Policy (CSP):</strong> Restrict what content is allowed to load on the webpages.  </li><br>

       <li><strong>Backup data</strong> on a regular basis. “In case of fire”, please keep all the website data backed up. </li><br>
        
       <li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Utilize a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to monitor and filter the incoming web traffic.  </li><br>
    
       <li><strong>Educate:</strong> help the client and future users stay UpToDate on good practices regarding web security </li></ul>
